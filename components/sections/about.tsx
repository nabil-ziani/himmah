                        Himmah is a platform that is meant to empower Muslims by increasing their productivity and zeal.
                        As Muslims suffer from distractions, self-doubt, weakness and many more issues, we want to provide a solution.
                        We hope to create more successful Muslims, who will please Allah and strive to create a better world.
